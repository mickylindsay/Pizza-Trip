An uncovered relic thought lost to time. After nearly 10 years, a "start of sophomore year" hackathon project turned up.

There is no surviving git blame because we.. I mean they did not yet know how to utitilze source control. The authors will not be named to protect their reputation, but it is important to note that only a short few years later these students would go on to work for software companies the likes of Amazon, Google, and Apple.

# Pizza-Trip
A quick libgdx game built during hack ISU

Inspiration
A game where physics are determined by other arbitrary values.

What it does
A simple 2d platform race game for 2 players

How I built it
libgdx, java and Box2d

Challenges I ran into
Projectiles physiscs, and camera controls were all challenging

Accomplishments that I'm proud of
A lot of hard work was put into the game by the whole team and we all had fun doing it. We came in not knowing anything about libgdx but now we are much more seasoned and used to it.

What I learned
I learned a lot about game engines and game dev in general(My first game) I also had afun time trying to code as a team. Overall I learned a ton and had a lot of fun.

What's next for Pizza Trip
Maybe a full rebuild implimenting better physics art and overall design, mixed with a better combat system and online multiplayer support. E3 2016 here we come.
